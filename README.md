# Scheduling-And-Workload-Distribution-in-Computational-Grids
With the development in technologies and large resource intensive applications, 
a large scale distributed system has emerged as popular platforms. 
Distributed system involves integration of large number of resources which may be geographically dispersed. 
Hence, proper techniques are required for scheduling the job and balanced load distribution among recourses.

Scheduling of tasks in distributed system involves deciding not only
when to execute a process, but also where to execute it. A proper task scheduling will
enhance the resource utilization, reduces execution time and increases system throughput.


In this project, a heuristic approach using an Ant colony optimization algorithm is
proposed. In the natural environment, the ants have a tremendous ability to team up to
find an optimal path to food resources. An ant algorithm simulates the behavior of ants.
The overall objective of the proposed Ant Based Approach is to minimize Make Span
while maximizing CPU utilization by distributing workload equally among the available
resources. This research compares the proposed approach with the Random approach on
the basis of Make span and the utilization of resources in the system.
